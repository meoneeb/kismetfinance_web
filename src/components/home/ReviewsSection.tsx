      "A friend of mine referred us to Kismet to help us out with our interest rates. The process was nice and convenient, we had one of the fellas come out to our place and then we were visited by one of their Senior Specialists who also showed us some other strategies, me being FIFO and paying so much tax was a killer but Dan showed us some ways to tax minimise and helped with those interest rates... Cheers guys, you‚Äôre all really a good bunch of people! Looking forward to our next catch up.",

Im not overly financially savvy but they have been there every step of the way. I wish there were more than 5 stars! Thanks again.",

      "I honestly wish someone like Dan was around years ago to help educate the public about superannuation. He is very informative, patient and clearly outlines investment goals and procedures. My Self Managed Super Fund is actually working productively and I am very comfortable with my future retirement plans. Kismet has great customer service with regular check ups to ensure you understand that everything is ok and on track. I highly recommend the team Dan, Josh, Shane and Stuart to anyone who is seeking knowledgeable, experienced and trustworthy advisors to help plan and manage your financial future. It's a 5 star review and big thumbs up from me *****üëç",
